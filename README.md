# UFOs Analysis

## Overview of Project

Dana's webpage is working with the intended search criteria for dates. However, she would like add more table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. With this new project, we'll be helping Dana filter for UFO sightings based on multiple criteria. This new add in feature will create a more interactive site that is user friendly for those looking to filter through the data based upon multiple criteria. 



## Results

The website is filtered through the search on the left side of the page and it can be filtered in the following ways:

1. Enter Date - Here the date can be entered in the form of "X/XX/XXXX", for example in 2010 if we are looking for a specific day we can filter to it and hit enter to display the results.
