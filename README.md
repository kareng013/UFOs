# UFOs Analysis

## Overview of Project

Dana's webpage is working with the intended search criteria for dates. However, she would like add more table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. With this new project, we'll be helping Dana filter for UFO sightings based on multiple criteria. This new add in feature will create a more interactive site that is user friendly for those looking to filter through the data based upon multiple criteria. 



## Results

The website is filtered through the search on the left side of the page and it can be filtered in the following steps:

1. Enter Date - Here the date can be entered in the form of "X/XX/XXXX", for example in 2010 if we are looking for a specific day we can filter to it and hit enter to display the results.

2. Search by City - Search for sighting can be specific to certain cities. Example, uxbridge.

3. Search by State - Use the "XX" format for states to search by the abbreviations. Example, AZ.

## Summary

A major drawback of this design is users have no idea what they're looking for when they are entering the site. They may be curious about a certain shape or state or city for which no data exists in the table. The filter option is flawed in the sense you have to look at the key words in the table and enter based on what exists already that you see. 

Below are the following solutions:
 -Drop down bar to see what can be selected from in the dataset
 -If spelt incorrectly, option for nearest spelling
 -Map to see the sightings and how close or far they are from each other
